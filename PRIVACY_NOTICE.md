# Privacy Notice — CuePoint v1.0

**Last updated**: 2025-12-14  
**Applies to**: CuePoint v1.0

## Summary (plain language)
- CuePoint v1.0 **does not** include telemetry or analytics.
- CuePoint processes your Rekordbox collection **locally on your device**.
- CuePoint makes network requests **only when you initiate actions** that require it (e.g., Beatport lookups).
- CuePoint stores some data **locally** (settings, cache, logs). You can clear it from **Help → Privacy**.

## Who we are
CuePoint is an open-source desktop application maintained by the CuePoint project contributors.

## Information we collect
### v1.0 — no telemetry / analytics
CuePoint v1.0 does **not** collect telemetry, analytics, or usage tracking data, and it does not send your Rekordbox collection to our servers.

### User-initiated network requests
CuePoint may make network requests when you use features that require them:
- **Beatport lookups**: when you run processing/search that queries Beatport for metadata.
- **DuckDuckGo** (if you use the related search integration): user-initiated.
- **Update checking**: if/when you use update checking features (and when enabled).

These requests go directly from your device to the third-party service.

## How we use information
- **Local processing**: to parse your Rekordbox XML and generate results/exports.
- **Caching** (optional/local): to speed up repeated lookups.
- **Logging** (optional/local): to help diagnose issues. Logs are **sanitized** to avoid recording secrets/tokens.

We do not sell or rent personal information.

## What is stored on your device
CuePoint may store the following **locally**:
- **Configuration**: app settings and preferences.
- **Cache**: cached responses/derived data to improve performance.
- **Logs**: application logs (rotated; sanitized).
- **Exports**: files you export (CSV/Excel/JSON) to a location you choose.

You can manage and delete local data in the app:
- **Help → Privacy**: clear cache/logs/config and set “clear on exit” options.

## Your choices and controls
- Clear cache/logs/config from **Help → Privacy**.
- Optionally enable “clear cache on exit” and “clear logs on exit”.

## Third-party services
CuePoint may interact with third-party services you choose to use (e.g., Beatport, DuckDuckGo, GitHub hosting for updates). Their privacy practices are governed by their own policies.

## Changes to this notice
If data practices change in a future version, this notice will be updated and the “Last updated” date will change.
