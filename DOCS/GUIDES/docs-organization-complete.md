# DOCS Folder Reorganization Complete ✅

The DOCS folder has been successfully reorganized into a cleaner, more logical structure!

## New Structure

```

├── README.md                    # Main documentation index
├── GUIDES/                       # User guides
│   └── ...
├── DEVELOPMENT/                  # Developer documentation
│   ├── guidelines/              # Coding standards, testing, error handling
│   └── architecture/            # Architecture docs
├── PHASES/                      # Phase documentation
│   ├── completed/              # Completed phases (0-7)
│   ├── in_progress/            # Current phase (8)
│   └── future/                 # Future features
├── DESIGNS/                     # Design documents

```

## What Was Moved

### Development Documentation
- ✅ `ERROR_HANDLING_GUIDELINES.md` → `DEVELOPMENT/guidelines/`
- ✅ `TESTING_GUIDELINES.md` → `DEVELOPMENT/guidelines/`
- ✅ `DEVELOPMENT/coding-standards.md` → `DEVELOPMENT/`
- ✅ `SEARCH_ARCHITECTURE.md` → `DEVELOPMENT/architecture/`
- ✅ `PERFORMANCE_CHARACTERISTICS.md` → `DEVELOPMENT/architecture/`

### Phase Documentation
- ✅ Phases 0-7 → `PHASES/completed/`
- ✅ Phase 8 → `PHASES/in_progress/`
- ✅ Future Features → `PHASES/future/`

### Design Documents
- ✅ Implemented designs → `DESIGNS/implemented/`
- ✅ Future designs → `DESIGNS/future/`
- ✅ Old designs → `DESIGNS/ARCHIVE/`

### Archive

## Benefits

## Quick Access

- **User Guides**: `GUIDES/`
- **Developer Docs**: `DEVELOPMENT/`
- **Implementation History**: `PHASES/completed/`
- **Current Work**: `PHASES/in_progress/`
- **Future Plans**: `PHASES/future/` or `DESIGNS/future/`
