# Implementation Step 11.9: Issue Triage & Prioritization

## Implementation Overview
**What We're Building**: Issue triage and prioritization workflow using GitHub Issues (FREE, EASIEST). This includes issue classification, priority system, assignment workflow, and resolution tracking.

## Strategic Context

### Why Issue Triage Matters

Issue triage is critical for:
- **Efficiency**: Prioritize important issues
- **Organization**: Keep issues organized
- **Accountability**: Assign issues to team members
- **Tracking**: Track issue resolution
- **Quality**: Ensure issues are resolved properly

**The Challenge**: Without triage, issues pile up and important ones get lost.

**The Solution**: GitHub Issues with labels and projects (FREE, EASIEST).

## Implementation Decision: GitHub Issues (EASIEST, FREE)

**Why GitHub Issues**:
- ✅ **FREE**: No cost
- ✅ **EASIEST**: Already have GitHub account
- ✅ **INTEGRATED**: Works with existing workflow
- ✅ **FLEXIBLE**: Can customize with labels
- ✅ **TRACKABLE**: Easy to track progress

## Implementation Tasks

### Task 11.9.1: Issue Classification System

**What to Create**
- Priority labels
- Type labels
- Status labels
- Auto-labeling configuration

**Implementation Details**

**11.9.1.1 Priority Labels**

**Labels to Create** (in GitHub):
- `priority: critical` - Security issues, data loss, app crashes
- `priority: high` - Major bugs, missing features
- `priority: medium` - Minor bugs, enhancements
- `priority: low` - Nice-to-have features, polish

**11.9.1.2 Type Labels**

**Labels to Create**:
- `type: bug` - Bug reports
- `type: feature` - Feature requests
- `type: enhancement` - Enhancements
- `type: question` - Questions
- `type: documentation` - Documentation issues

**11.9.1.3 Status Labels**

**Labels to Create**:
- `status: triage` - Needs triage
- `status: in-progress` - Work in progress
- `status: blocked` - Blocked by something
- `status: needs-review` - Needs code review
- `status: resolved` - Resolved

**11.9.1.4 Auto-Labeling**

**File to Create**: `.github/labeler.yml`

**Content**:
```yaml
# Auto-label issues based on template
bug: '**/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.yml'
feature: '**/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.yml'
question: '**/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/support_question.yml'
```

### Task 11.9.2: Triage Process

**What to Create**
- Triage workflow documentation
- Triage checklist
- Assignment rules

**Implementation Details**

**11.9.2.1 Triage Workflow**

**File to Create**: `DOCS/OPERATIONS/Triage_Workflow.md`

**Content**:
```markdown
# Issue Triage Workflow

## Triage Process

1. **New Issue Submitted**
   - Auto-label based on template
   - Add `status: triage` label

2. **Triage Review**
   - Review issue details
   - Classify priority
   - Classify type
   - Add appropriate labels

3. **Assignment**
   - Assign to appropriate team member
   - Set milestone (if applicable)
   - Update status to `status: in-progress`

4. **Resolution**
   - Fix issue
   - Update status to `status: resolved`
   - Close issue

## Priority Guidelines

### Critical
- Security vulnerabilities
- Data loss
- App crashes
- Critical bugs

### High
- Major bugs
- Missing critical features
- Performance issues

### Medium
- Minor bugs
- Enhancements
- Documentation updates

### Low
- Nice-to-have features
- UI polish
- Non-critical improvements
```

**11.9.2.2 Triage Checklist**

**Checklist**:
- [ ] Issue is clear and actionable
- [ ] Priority is set
- [ ] Type is set
- [ ] Labels are applied
- [ ] Issue is assigned

### Task 11.9.3: GitHub Projects

**What to Create**
- GitHub Project board
- Project columns
- Automation rules

**Implementation Details**

**11.9.3.1 Project Board**

**Columns to Create**:
- **Triage** - New issues
- **In Progress** - Issues being worked on
- **Review** - Issues needing review
- **Done** - Resolved issues

**11.9.3.2 Automation**

**Automation Rules**:
- Move to "In Progress" when assigned
- Move to "Review" when PR is created
- Move to "Done" when issue is closed

## Files to Create/Modify

### New Files
1. `.github/labeler.yml` - Auto-labeling config
2. `DOCS/OPERATIONS/Triage_Workflow.md` - Triage workflow

### GitHub Configuration
1. Create labels in GitHub
