# Implementation Step 11.7: Community Management

## Implementation Overview
**What We're Building**: Community management infrastructure using GitHub Discussions (FREE, EASIEST). This includes community guidelines, engagement strategy, and moderation procedures.

## Strategic Context

### Why Community Management Matters

Community management is critical for:
- **User Engagement**: Active community keeps users engaged
- **Support**: Community helps each other
- **Feedback**: Community provides valuable feedback
- **Growth**: Community drives product growth
- **Advocacy**: Community members become advocates

**The Challenge**: Without community management, community doesn't grow.

**The Solution**: GitHub Discussions + Guidelines (FREE, EASIEST).

## Implementation Decision: GitHub Discussions (EASIEST, FREE)

**Why GitHub Discussions**:
- ✅ **FREE**: No cost
- ✅ **EASIEST**: Already have GitHub account
- ✅ **INTEGRATED**: Works with existing workflow
- ✅ **FAMILIAR**: Team already knows how to use it
- ✅ **FLEXIBLE**: Can organize by categories
