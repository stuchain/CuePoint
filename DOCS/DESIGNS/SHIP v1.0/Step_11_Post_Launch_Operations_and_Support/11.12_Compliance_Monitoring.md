# Implementation Step 11.12: Compliance Monitoring

## Implementation Overview
**What We're Building**: Compliance monitoring system using automated scripts (FREE, EASIEST). This includes license compliance, privacy compliance, security compliance, and accessibility compliance monitoring.

## Strategic Context

### Why Compliance Monitoring Matters

Compliance monitoring is critical for:
- **Legal Protection**: Avoid legal issues
- **License Compliance**: Respect third-party licenses
- **Privacy Compliance**: Meet GDPR/CCPA requirements
- **Security Compliance**: Maintain security standards
- **Accessibility Compliance**: Meet accessibility requirements

**The Challenge**: Without compliance monitoring, compliance issues go undetected.

**The Solution**: Automated compliance checks (FREE, scripts already exist from Step 8).

## Implementation Decision: Automated Scripts (EASIEST, FREE)

**Why Automated Scripts**:
- ✅ **FREE**: No cost
- ✅ **EASIEST**: Scripts already exist
- ✅ **AUTOMATED**: Can run in CI
- ✅ **COMPREHENSIVE**: Covers all compliance areas

**Existing Infrastructure** (from Step 8):
- `scripts/validate_licenses.py` - License compliance
- `scripts/validate_compliance.py` - General compliance
- `.github/workflows/compliance-check.yml` - CI compliance check
