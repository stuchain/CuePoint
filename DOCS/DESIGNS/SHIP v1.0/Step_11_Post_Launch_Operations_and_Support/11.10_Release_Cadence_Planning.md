# Implementation Step 11.10: Release Cadence Planning

## Implementation Overview
**What We're Building**: Release cadence planning and documentation (FREE, EASIEST). This includes release strategy, release schedule, release types, and release communication plan.

## Strategic Context

### Why Release Cadence Matters

Release cadence is critical for:
- **Predictability**: Users know when to expect updates
- **Quality**: Regular releases maintain quality
- **Stability**: Predictable releases reduce surprises
- **Planning**: Team can plan work around releases
- **Communication**: Clear release schedule improves communication

**The Challenge**: Without release cadence, releases are unpredictable.

**The Solution**: Document release strategy and schedule (FREE).

## Implementation Decision: Documentation (EASIEST, FREE)

**Why Documentation**:
- ✅ **FREE**: No cost
- ✅ **EASIEST**: Just document the plan
- ✅ **FLEXIBLE**: Can adjust as needed
- ✅ **CLEAR**: Everyone knows the plan
