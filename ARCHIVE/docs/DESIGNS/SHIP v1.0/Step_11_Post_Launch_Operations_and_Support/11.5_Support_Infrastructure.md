# Implementation Step 11.5: Support Infrastructure

## Implementation Overview
**What We're Building**: Professional user support infrastructure using GitHub Issues and GitHub Discussions (FREE, EASIEST). This includes support channels, issue templates, support workflow, and response procedures.

## Strategic Context

### Why Support Infrastructure Matters

Support infrastructure is critical for:
- **User Satisfaction**: Quick, helpful support improves user experience
- **Issue Resolution**: Efficient support processes resolve issues faster
- **Community Building**: Support channels build user community
- **Product Improvement**: Support feedback drives product improvements
- **User Retention**: Good support keeps users engaged

**The Challenge**: Without support infrastructure, user issues go unresolved.

**The Solution**: GitHub Issues + GitHub Discussions (FREE, already have account).

## Implementation Decision: GitHub Issues + Discussions (EASIEST, FREE)

**Why GitHub Issues + Discussions**:
- ✅ **FREE**: No cost
- ✅ **EASIEST**: Already have GitHub account
- ✅ **INTEGRATED**: Works with existing workflow
- ✅ **FAMILIAR**: Team already knows how to use it
- ✅ **FLEXIBLE**: Can customize with templates
- ✅ **SEARCHABLE**: Easy to find answers
- ✅ **COLLABORATIVE**: Community can help each other
