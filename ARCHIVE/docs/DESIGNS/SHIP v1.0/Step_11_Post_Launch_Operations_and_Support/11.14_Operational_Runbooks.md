# Implementation Step 11.14: Operational Runbooks

## Implementation Overview
**What We're Building**: Comprehensive operational runbooks documenting common procedures, troubleshooting guides, and emergency procedures (FREE, EASIEST). This includes runbook structure, key runbooks, and runbook maintenance.

## Strategic Context

### Why Operational Runbooks Matter

Operational runbooks are critical for:
- **Efficiency**: Standardized procedures save time
- **Consistency**: Consistent procedures reduce errors
- **Knowledge Sharing**: Document institutional knowledge
- **Onboarding**: Help new team members
- **Emergency Response**: Quick response to emergencies

**The Challenge**: Without runbooks, procedures are inconsistent and knowledge is lost.

**The Solution**: Document procedures in Markdown (FREE, EASIEST).

## Implementation Decision: Markdown Documentation (EASIEST, FREE)

**Why Markdown Documentation**:
- ✅ **FREE**: No cost
- ✅ **EASIEST**: Simple Markdown files
- ✅ **VERSIONED**: Tracked in Git
- ✅ **SEARCHABLE**: Easy to search
- ✅ **ACCESSIBLE**: Easy to access

### Task 11.14.2: Create Key Runbooks

**What to Create**
- Release deployment runbook
- Rollback procedure runbook
- Security incident response runbook
- Support escalation runbook

**Implementation Details**

**11.14.2.1 Release Deployment Runbook**

**File to Create**: `DOCS/OPERATIONS/Release/Release_Deployment.md`

**Content**:
```markdown
# Release Deployment Runbook

## Purpose
Deploy a new release to production.

## Prerequisites
- Release is tested and approved
- Release tag is created
- Release notes are prepared

## Steps

### Step 1: Pre-Deployment Checks
1. Verify all tests pass
2. Verify release notes are complete
3. Verify version number is correct
4. Verify changelog is updated

### Step 2: Create Release Tag
1. Create release tag: `git tag v1.0.0`
2. Push tag: `git push origin v1.0.0`
3. Verify tag is created

### Step 3: Trigger Release Workflow
1. GitHub Actions will automatically:
   - Build artifacts
   - Sign and notarize
   - Create GitHub release
   - Publish update feeds

### Step 4: Verify Release
1. Verify GitHub release is created
2. Verify artifacts are uploaded
3. Verify update feeds are published
4. Test download and installation

### Step 5: Announce Release
1. Post release announcement
2. Update documentation
3. Notify users (if applicable)

## Verification
- [ ] Release is published
- [ ] Artifacts are available
- [ ] Update feeds are working
- [ ] Release announcement is posted

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Release workflow fails
**Solution**: Check workflow logs, fix issues, retry

### Issue: Artifacts not signed
**Solution**: Check signing certificates, verify secrets

**11.14.2.2 Rollback Procedure Runbook**

**File to Create**: `DOCS/OPERATIONS/Release/Rollback_Procedure.md`

**Content**:
```markdown
# Rollback Procedure Runbook

## Purpose
Rollback a release that has critical issues.

## Prerequisites
- Previous release is identified
- Rollback is approved
- Users are notified (if applicable)

## Steps

### Step 1: Identify Previous Release
1. Find last stable release
2. Note release version
3. Verify release artifacts exist

### Step 2: Update Release Feeds
1. Remove problematic release from feeds
2. Update feeds to point to previous release
3. Verify feeds are updated

### Step 3: Announce Rollback
1. Post rollback announcement
2. Explain reason for rollback
3. Provide timeline for fix

### Step 4: Fix Issues
1. Identify and fix issues
2. Test fixes
3. Prepare new release
