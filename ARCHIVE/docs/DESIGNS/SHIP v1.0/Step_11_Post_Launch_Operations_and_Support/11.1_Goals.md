# Implementation Step 11.1: Goals

## Implementation Overview
**What We're Building**: Define clear operational objectives, success criteria, and guiding principles for post-launch operations and support infrastructure. This establishes the foundation for all operational activities and ensures alignment on what "success" means for post-launch operations.

## Strategic Context

### Why Operational Goals Matter

Post-launch operations are critical for:
- **User Satisfaction**: Professional support and monitoring improve user experience
- **Product Quality**: Error monitoring and analytics help identify and fix issues
- **Sustainable Growth**: Well-documented processes enable scaling
- **Compliance**: Ongoing monitoring ensures continued compliance
- **Community Building**: Support infrastructure enables community growth

**The Challenge**: Without clear goals, operations become reactive and inefficient.

**The Solution**: Define measurable objectives and success criteria upfront.

## Implementation Tasks
