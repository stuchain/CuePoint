# Step 1.3 Implementation Summary

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Workflow Documentation Created

#### Workflow 1: First Run
- **Documented**: Complete step-by-step flow
- **Status**: ⚠️ Partially implemented
- **Missing**: Onboarding dialog (Step 9.4), first-run detection
- **File**: `1.3_WORKFLOW_IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md`

#### Workflow 2: Repeat Run
- **Documented**: State persistence requirements
- **Status**: ⚠️ Partially implemented
- **Existing**: Recent files menu and storage ✅
- **Missing**: Window geometry persistence, last playlist/mode memory
- **File**: `1.3_WORKFLOW_IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md`

#### Workflow 3: Review/Refine
- **Documented**: Filter and candidate review flow
- **Status**: ✅ Fully implemented
- **Components**: All filtering, candidate dialog, re-export working

#### Workflow 4: Past Searches
- **Documented**: CSV loading and re-run flow
- **Status**: ⚠️ Mostly implemented
- **Existing**: CSV loading, filtering, export ✅
- **Missing**: Re-run processing integration

#### Workflow 5: Update
- **Documented**: Update workflow requirements
- **Status**: ❌ Deferred to Step 5
- **Note**: Full implementation in Step 5

### 2. Implementation Status Analysis

Created comprehensive status tracking document:
- **File**: `1.3_WORKFLOW_IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md`
- **Content**: 
  - Implementation status for each workflow step
  - Component-by-component breakdown
  - Missing components identified
  - Enhancement needs documented

### 3. Code Review Completed

#### Existing Implementations ✅
- Recent files management (QSettings)
- XML file selection and validation
- Playlist selection (single and batch)
- Processing workflow with progress
- Results view with filtering
- Candidate review dialog
- Export functionality
- History view with CSV loading

#### Needs Enhancement ⚠️
- Window state persistence (geometry, playlist, mode)
- First-run detection and onboarding trigger
- Progress indication integration (use ProgressTracker)
- Re-run processing integration
- Filter presets

#### Needs Creation ❌
- Onboarding dialog (Step 9.4)
- Update checker (Step 5)
- Update dialog (Step 5)

## Implementation Priority

### High Priority (Blocking Workflows)
1. **State Persistence** (Workflow 2)
   - Window geometry save/restore
   - Last playlist/mode memory
   - Auto-load last XML

2. **First-Run Detection** (Workflow 1)
   - Check if first run
   - Trigger onboarding
   - Save first-run flag

3. **Re-run Integration** (Workflow 4)
   - Connect rerun signal to main window
   - Extract original XML path
   - Validate XML exists

### Medium Priority (Enhancements)
1. **Progress Indication** (All Workflows)
   - Integrate ProgressTracker
   - Enhanced progress dialogs

2. **Filter Presets** (Workflow 3)
   - Save/load filter presets
   - Quick filter buttons

## Files Created/Modified

### Documentation
- `DOCS/DESIGNS/SHIP v1.0/Step_1_Product_Requirements/1.3_WORKFLOW_IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md` (created)
- `DOCS/DESIGNS/SHIP v1.0/Step_1_Product_Requirements/1.3_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` (this file)
- `DOCS/DESIGNS/SHIP v1.0/01_Product_Requirements_and_Definition.md` (enhanced with workflow status)

### Code Analysis
- Reviewed main window implementation
- Reviewed workflow components
- Identified gaps and enhancement needs

## Success Criteria Met

✅ All five workflows documented  
✅ Implementation status tracked  
✅ Missing components identified  
✅ Enhancement needs documented  
✅ Code review completed  
✅ Priority established

## Next Steps

Step 1.3 is complete. The workflows are documented and will guide:
- **Step 1.8**: UX Requirements (workflows inform UX decisions)
- **Step 1.9**: Operational Requirements (state persistence)
- **Step 9.4**: Onboarding implementation (Workflow 1)
- **Step 5**: Update system (Workflow 5)

## Integration Notes

The utilities created in Step 1.1 will enhance workflows:
- **ProgressTracker**: Will be integrated into processing workflows (Step 1.8)
- **MetricsCollector**: Will track workflow completion rates (Step 1.9)
- **Export Service**: Already enhanced, used in Workflows 1, 3, 4
