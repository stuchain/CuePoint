# CuePoint - pinned dependencies for shipped builds
#
# This file is used for reproducible release builds (Step 8.2).
# Keep `requirements.txt` flexible for development; keep this pinned for CI/release packaging.
#
# NOTE: Pins are currently aligned to the minimum versions declared in requirements.txt.

# IMPORTANT: This file must include ALL runtime dependencies from requirements.txt
# (excluding test dependencies) to ensure the packaged app works correctly.
